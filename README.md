- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Ben-Culver a Salseforce certified admin and aspiring developer. Here I'm building a collection of code
  I've written to solve problems I couldn't find already made answers to. That's not to say there isn't someone out there who already
  covered a topic better, just that I didn't find them. It's a little bare now but check back from time to time and see what's new.
- Nearly every piece of code should have a coorisponding youtube video with a walkthrough of how it can be used.
